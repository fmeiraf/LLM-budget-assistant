- Parse raw account transactions
- Assign categories based on transactions names (try to make this as consistent and flexible as possible)
- Split big inputs from customers that might exceed model max tokens limitations (i.e 4096 etc)
- Simple dashboard for data visualization
- Enable user to talk to its own data through chat UI""",
